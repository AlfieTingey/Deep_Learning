# Deep_Learning
This repository contains examples of code that I have completed that are related to topic Deep Learning

We have one file that is dedicated to the theory and applications of Convolutional Neural Networks, another on Generative Adversarial networks such as VAEs, and another on LSTMS, RNNs, and GANs. All files are in Jupyter Notebook format.
